    Items are displayed in an organized wishlist on the right-hand side of the page.

Personal Preferences:

        1. Favorite colors
        2. Pant size
        3. Ring size
        4. Shirt size

Sharing:
    The wishlist and preferences can be shared with friends and family, helping them choose the perfect gift.
